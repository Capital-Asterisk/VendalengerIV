    <h3>woof shredder</h3>
    <p>
    A program that visualizes algorithms. The project is on hiatus because it's JavaScript, difficult to use, and needs more thinking put into it. Don't mind the weird name and logo.

    <h3>Rook Vs. Rook</h3>
    <p>
        Chess but it's an action game with only a single rook per player. There are no turns, and players must capture their opponent's rook with agility. This game can get pretty intense.
